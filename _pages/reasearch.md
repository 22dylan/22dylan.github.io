<summary> <b>Evaluating Future Impacts of Sea Level Rise on Coastal Communities </b> </summary>

<i> Summary: </i> <br>
I completed this work during my time as a National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow at NIST. The objective of this work was to develop decision-support tools to help communities become more resilient to chronic hazards that are associated with a changing climate. In particular, I focused on flooding due to sea-level rise and high tides, and the resulting impacts on buildings, electric power, and transportation networks.
