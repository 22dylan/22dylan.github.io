Dr. Dylan Sanderson is an incoming Associate Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). His areas of expertise include both coastal engineering and community resilience. 

Dylan's research focuses on assessing the impacts of natural and climatic hazards on the built and social environments at regional scales. Dylan is particularly interested in numerical and probabilistic modeling of the impacts of hazards, as well as developing and applying geospatial tools to inform community resilience planning. He enjoys using his expertise in community resilience modeling to work alongside and lead interdisciplinary teams. The ultimate aim of Dylan's research is to help communities become more resilient to future natural hazards.

Prior to beginning his upcoming position at JHU/NIST, Dylan was a [National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/rap/nrc-research-associateship-programs) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (2023-2025). In this role, Dylan worked on a funded research proposal to develop [geospatial decision-support tools](https://zenodo.org/records/15120769) to help communities prepare for the [future impacts of sea-level rise on buildings and infrastructure](https://zenodo.org/records/12573416). Prior to his postdoctoral fellowship, Dylan obtained both his PhD (2023) and MS (2020) degrees in Civil Engineering from Oregon State University (OSU). At OSU, Dylan worked with the [Seaside, Oregon multi-hazard testbed](https://22dylan.github.io/pyincore_seaside_jb/), developed a [coupled urban change and hazard consequence model](https://22dylan.github.io/UrbanChange-HazardConsequence/intro.html) to evaluate community resilience plans, contributed to [IN-CORE](https://tools.in-core.org/), and [developed of a model](https://tinyurl.com/rgnl-locl-resilience) to evaluate Oregon’s road and bridge transportation network under earthquake and tsunami hazards. Dylan previously worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Research and Development Center (USACE-ERDC) in the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (2016-2018). Here, he was a principal investigator for two probabilistic lifecycle analysis models of coastal storm risk reduction, Beach-fx and G2CRM.

Outside of work, Dylan enjoys long distance running, pretending he knows how to cook well, and spending time in/around Portland with his lovely partner. Together, they have one cat.
