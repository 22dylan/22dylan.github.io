About
======
Dr. Dylan Sanderson is an incoming Associate Research Scientist at Johns Hopkins University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Dylan's areas of expertise include both coastal engineering and community resilience. In regards to the former, Dylan is a coastal engineer by training with a strong educational background in coastal processes and fluid mechanics; whereas in regards to the latter, Dylan's research focuses on assessing the impacts of natural hazards on the built and social environments at regional scales. Dylan is particularly interested in computational approaches for improving community resilience to natural and climatic hazards. This includes numerical and probabilistic modeling of the impacts of hazards on communities, as well as developing and applying geospatial models to inform community resilience planning. Dylan is interested in using his expertise to work alongside and lead interdisciplinary teams. The ultimate aim of Dylan's research is to help communities become more resilient to future natural hazards.

Prior to beginning his current position at JHU/NIST, Dylan was a [National Research Council Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/rap/nrc-research-associateship-programs) at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (2023-2025). In this role, Dylan worked on a funded research proposal to develop geospatial decision-support tools to help communities prepare for the future impacts of sea-level rise on buildings and infrastructure. Prior to his postdoctoral fellowship, Dylan obtained both his PhD (2023) and MS (2020) degrees in Civil Engineering from Oregon State University (OSU). At OSU, Dylan worked with the Seaside, Oregon multi-hazard testbed, developed a coupled urban change and hazard consequence model to evaluate community resilience plans, contributed to IN-CORE, and developed of a model to evaluate Oregon’s road and bridge transportation network under earthquake and tsunami hazards. Dylan previously worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Research and Development Center (USACE-ERDC) in the Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory (2016-2018). Here, he was a principal investigator for two probabilistic lifecycle analysis models of coastal storm risk reduction, Beach-fx and G2CRM.

<!-- Outside of work, Dylan enjoys long distance running, pretending he knows how to cook well, and spending time in/around Portland with his lovely partner. Together, they have one cat. -->

<!-- Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your Markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the Markdown files! You can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html). -->

<!-- 
Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push the m to the GitHub repository.-->

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
